          There are very few open source collections of speech data where individual
	  words are spoken by a large number of different people. This makes it tough to
	  build good open source examples of detecting spoken keywords such as
	  &quot;Yes&quot;, &quot;No&quot;, &quot;On&quot;, or &quot;Off&quot;.
	</div>
	<div class="welcome-display">
	  To fill this gap, the <a href="https://aiyprojects.withgoogle.com/">AIY team</a>
	  is hoping to gather single spoken words from several hundred people and then release
	  the resulting data set under an open license, together with an example of how to use
	  it to create simple speech command classifiers.

Participant Agreement
Swarup Sahoo, for himself and other administrators of this web application, and the other party identified below (“You”) agree as follows:
	</div>
	<div class="legal">
1.	By participating, this website will ask for permission to use your microphone and prompt you to speak single words which we will record (the “Study”). These words will appear on-screen, one after another, over the course of around five minutes, with short pauses in between. When the microphone is active, you’ll see an oscilloscope display showing a waveform reflecting the audio received. The Record button will turn red when a word is being recorded (each a “clip”). Clips will be displayed in the bottom half of the web page where you can review and delete any of them locally before submitting them to Google. Clips will only be sent to Google when you press the ‘Upload’ button, or the ‘OK’ button on the dialog that appears once you’ve completed all the requested words. At any point you can press the ‘Stop’ button to pause the recording process. Navigating away from this website will remove all local copies of the clips.
	</div>
	<div class="legal">
2.	Your participation is voluntary and you may choose to cease participation at any time.<b>If you choose to participate in this Study, you must be in a quiet room with no other voices and only speak the requested words. A closed room is a good place for this</b>.
	</div>
  <div class="legal">
3.  Swarup Sahoo and other administrators of this application assume absolutely no legal liabilites related to this application or the data collected.
	</div>
	<div class="legal">
By clicking ‘I Agree’ you confirm that you are at least eighteen years of age, you understand the points above, and consent to the collection, use, and sharing of the Clips and to Google’s <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/?fg=1">Terms of Service</a> and <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/">Privacy Policy</a>.
